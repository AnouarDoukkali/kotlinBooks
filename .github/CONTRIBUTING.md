# Contributing to KotlinNewProjectTemplate

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/AnouarDoukkali/KotlinNewProjectTemplate/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/AnouarDoukkali/KotlinNewProjectTemplate/issues); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report I wrote, and I think it's not a bad model. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408), an app developer whom I greatly respect.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification

## Conventions and Best Practices for Pull Requests

- **Do your work in a branch.** Branches should be created off of `main`. Keep your branch up-to-date with `main` by merging changes from `main` into your branch.
- **Keep your PRs small.** Smaller PRs are easier to review and are more likely to be merged quickly. A good rule of thumb is that a PR should address only one issue or feature.
- **Write descriptive commit messages.** Good commit messages serve at least three important purposes:
  - They speed up the reviewing process.
  - They help us write a good release note.
  - They help the future maintainers of the project (it could be you!), say five years into the future, to find out why a particular change was made to the code or why a specific feature was added.
- **Address review feedback.** After a PR is sent out, it will be reviewed. If the reviewers ask for changes, make the changes and commit them to your branch. Push your changes to the repository and the PR will be updated automatically.
- **Merge once the PR is approved.** Once your PR is approved, go ahead and merge it to `main`. If you don't have write access to the repository, a reviewer will merge it for you.

Remember, contributions to this project are a conversation, not a one-off. We are here to help you contribute successfully.
