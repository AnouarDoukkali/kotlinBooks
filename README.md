# :sparkles: Kotlin Project Template :sparkles:

This repository serves as a template for new Kotlin projects, providing a starting point for Kotlin developers with pre-configured tools and libraries to ensure high-quality code and documentation standards.

## :rocket: Features

This Kotlin project template includes the following features and components:

- **Kotlin**: A modern programming language that makes developers happier.
- **KoTest**: A flexible and comprehensive testing tool for Kotlin.
- **Detekt**: A static code analysis tool for Kotlin to detect and report code smells.
- **Dokka**: A documentation engine for Kotlin, which can generate documentation in multiple formats.
- **Convention Plugins**: This Kotlin project template also utilizes convention plugins to standardize and simplify the build process.

## :books: Convention Plugins

Convention plugins are regular Gradle plugins that encapsulate shared build logic and can be applied across multiple projects or modules. They help to maintain consistency, reduce duplication, and improve build script readability.

The following convention plugins are included in this template:

- **Kotlin JVM Plugin**: This plugin is essential for building Kotlin projects with Gradle. It provides tasks to compile Kotlin source files, run tests, generate documentation, and more.
- **Dokka Plugin**: Dokka is a documentation engine for Kotlin, which can generate documentation in multiple formats. The Dokka plugin integrates this functionality into the Gradle build process.
- **KoTest Plugin**: KoTest is a flexible and comprehensive testing tool for Kotlin. The KoTest plugin allows you to run KoTest tests as part of your Gradle build.
- **Detekt Plugin**: Detekt is a static code analysis tool for Kotlin to detect and report code smells. The Detekt plugin integrates Detekt into the Gradle build process, allowing you to check your code for issues as part of the build.
